(v2010.06.20) WPAMPTR - V2010.06.20 - LGPL
This program provides "Animated Mouse
Pointer for OS/2." Use the animations that
come with the program or easily create your
own animations. All you need for that is the
OS/2 built-in Icon Editor and a good idea.
Win* cursors, Win* and AniMouse animation
files supported. WPS integrated SOM class.
German and Englisch NLS. More NLS planned.
